DS4 Calibration
If you are here, there are good probabilities you want to recalibrate your DS4. In that case, the script for you is ds4-calibration-tool.py.

The DS4 by default will undo changes after a reset or after it goes in standby. This is good to test calibration and see if the result is good enough for you without messing everything up.

At some point you may want to make changes permanent. To do that, you should change the flash-mirror status using ds4-tool. I suggest to switch back to temporary right after the calibration is done.

Here it follows an example:use Windows PowerShell

# 0. Set location of tool
set-location "folder link"

# 1. Know if changes are temporary or permanent (0: permanent; 1: temporary)
python ./ds4-tool.py get-flash-mirror-status 

# 2. Change flash mirror behavior to permanent
python ./ds4-tool.py set-flash-mirror-status 0

# 3. Do calibration here
python ./ds4-calibration-tool.py

# 4. Change flash mirror behavior back to temporary
python ./ds4-tool.py set-flash-mirror-status 1
